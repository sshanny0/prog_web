<p><center>Every single one of our customers are always the inspiration to everything that we do. That was how it all started for
us and how it’s always going to be! With ‘casual with a twist’ always in mind, there’s one thing that we promise all
of you with every piece of our clothing—it has to be something that any woman with every body type and
personality would proudly wear on a daily basis. That’s why we always love to see how all of you like to wear your favorite products!
Don’t forget to always be inspiring, be you!

<p><center>We always like to say, that we are proudly Indonesian. Every single thing that we produce is made by
local partners, because we want to strengthen the love of our beloved customers for locally made products!
Which was why in 2012, we decided to utilise the beautiful traditionally-made Batik and Ikat fabrics
and incorporate them into our clothing. Of course, still with our ‘casual with a twist style’.</center></p>

<p><center>It was all started with a dream.
In 2008, we decided to create something from nothing - a brand that was founded out of our love and passion for
fashion. We've put our heart and soul into every step that we take along the way - from designing to producing,
until the clothes are hanging neatly in our racks; ready to be delivered to you. 'Casual With A Twist' is how we
like to describe our clothing; because simplicity is key, and less is always more. Our ultimate dream is to
create a sustainable brand with local partners and most of all - to always provide the best for you.

Because you are the inspiration for everything that we do.
Be inspiring, be you.
#LoveToujoursBellé</center></p>
